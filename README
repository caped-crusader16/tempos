ABOUT:

	TempOS = TempOS is an educational and multi purpose Operating System

	TempOS was born for an undergraduate work and has it's your main goal
	to be not only another Operating System, but a complete toolkit
	designed to help students on their O.S. courses.

	TempOS it's under a true development stage, which means that it's
	not complete functional yet. The parts currently done are:

		- Multiboot implementation to Boot TempOS with GRUB
		- Page system working with 4Kb pages
		- Re-allocable kernel to 3GB on virtual space
		- A simple memory manager
		- A simple keyboard driver
		- IRQ system with shared IRQs support
		- A poor video (text mode) driver
		- System calls support development started


HISTORY:
	TempOS was born as an undergraduate project designed by
	Renê de Souza Pinto (computer engineering student) at
	University of São Paulo - USP, at São Carlos, from Brazil.
	The principal goal it's build a O.S. as a toolkit to help
	students at their O.S. courses, providing a real and not so
	complex project that students can put their hands on,
	understanding the principles and theories of Operating Systems
	in a pratical way.

	TempOS was written by Renê de Souza Pinto and supervised by
	the PhD teacher Francisco José Monaco, at University of

BUILD AND INSTALL:

	To build and test TempOS simple type:

		# make tempos
		# make install && make test

	The following dependencies are necessary to build and test TempOS:

		- An POSIX operating system (TempOS was written and tested with Linux)
		- Build tools: gcc, make, gnu assembler (provided by binutils package)
		- QEMU (for testing)

	Of course you can write disk.img at your pendrive, floppy disk, etc and boot
	TempOS in your computer, but, there is nothing to do with TempOS yet.


DEVELOPMENT:

	TempOS is currently developed only by Renê de Souza Pinto, but you can change
	this. Voluntaries are very, very Welcome to help TempOS grow up, any kind of
	help is wanted:

		- Improve TempOS code
		- Correct BUGS
		- Improve website and documentation (very necessary)
		- Develop new features
		- Anything...

	You are encouraged to contact the author and post your sugestions, critics,
	etc.
