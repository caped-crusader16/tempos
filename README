ABOUT:

	TempOS = TempOS is an educational and multi purpose Operating System

	TempOS was born for an undergraduate work and has it's your main goal
	to be not only another Operating System, but a complete toolkit
	designed to help students on their O.S. courses.

	TempOS it's under a true development stage, which means that it's
	not complete functional yet. The parts currently done are:

		- Multiboot implementation to Boot TempOS with GRUB
		- Page system working with 4Kb pages
		- Re-allocable kernel to 3GB on virtual space
		- A simple memory manager
		- A simple keyboard driver
		- IRQ system with shared IRQs support
		- Alarm timers
		- A poor video (text mode) driver
		- System calls support
		- Generic ATA driver
		- Kernel Multithreading

HISTORY:
	TempOS was born as an undergraduate project designed by
	Renê de Souza Pinto (computer engineering student) at
	University of São Paulo - USP, at São Carlos, from Brazil.
	The principal goal it's build a O.S. as a toolkit to help
	students at their O.S. courses, providing a real and not so
	complex project that students can put their hands on,
	understanding the principles and theories of Operating Systems
	in a pratical way.
