This folder contains the root directories and files structure of a common system
running TempOS, as the scripts and tools to generate a new environment.

You can use gen_hddisk_img.sh script to generate a Hard Disk image with the same
structure and files of rtree folder. This image should be used with QEMU to
emulate a system running TempOS.
