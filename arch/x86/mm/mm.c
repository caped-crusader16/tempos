/**
 * This is the low level memory manager system of TempOS
 *
 * TempOS uses a reallocable kernel, which means that kernel
 * are mapped to 3GB+1MB of virtual address space. This is done
 * using GDT trick while pageing system is not enable (in boot
 * stage). When paging system are working, GDT are reloaded with
 * base 0, since translation will be done by paging system.
